# Dotfiles

My personal `dotfiles` directory (MacOS/Omarchy) designed to be used with
[GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks.

Includes a modularized, manually configured, simple `zsh` configuration _without_
`oh-my-zsh` as well as configurations for applications on both MacOS and Omarchy, with optional gaming configuration on Omarchy using CachyOS.

## Usage

Run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesharper/.dotfiles/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash`
