# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles directory, including initialization scripts that install apps and set OS config. Intended to be used in conjunction with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to automatically generate symlinks in the correct locations. This repository is meant to be used with `stow .`, rather than `stow <package>`.

## Getting Started

Simply run the init script for the desired platform.

- MacOS: `source ~/dotfiles/init/macos.zsh`
