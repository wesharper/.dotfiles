# Dotfiles

My personal `dotfiles` directory (MacOS/Linux) designed to be used with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks.

Includes a modularized, manually configured, simple `zsh` config _without_ `oh-my-zsh` as well as configurations for a handful of applications in the `.config` folder.

If for some odd reason you want to try out my config or, more likely, if I move on to some new fun thing for long enough to forget what the hell I did here, just clone the repo (I put mine in `$HOME`) and run `stow .`.

**Use caution, as you may accidentally overwrite files you don't want to lose.**
